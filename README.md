# STXR -- Simple Text Renderer #  
Single-header OpenGL Text Renderer for .BMP Character Atlases.  

### Dependencies ###  
OpenGL  
GLEW  
stb_image  
GLFW(required only to run the example code)  

### Notes ###  
Credit to Codehead's Bitmap Font Generator for generating character atlases for rendering: http://www.codehead.co.uk/cbfg/.
It's recommended that you use his tool to create your atlases from TrueType font files.
I've included all the .bmp character atlases I've ever made in the 'fonts' folder, some of these fonts may be subject to
 copyright. Obviously, I am not the creator or owner of these fonts.
